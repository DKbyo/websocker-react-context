## websocket-react-context

This is a brief example of use websockets with the new React Context API, I tried to follow the react-redux-saga aproach, so you can declare async functions in ./sagas/example.saga.js and call them in ./components/grandParent.js using dispatch. 

## How call async functions?

See [React Context Saga](https://github.com/DKbyo/react-context-saga)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
